# Deep Learning for Text Analysis

The purpose of this research is to investigate the problems of plagiarism and artificial generation of text content, ways to solve them, and create a solution for identifying these problems in texts.

* The process and results of comparing text embedding models for further fine-tuning are presented in notebook paraphrasing/Paraphrasing_graph_comparison.ipynb.
* The results of training and fine-tuning the final model to solve a problem of identifying artificial text generation is presented in a notebook en_generating/en_generating_bert.ipynb.
* The results of training and fine-tuning the final model to solve a problem of artificial text in notebook generationparaphrasing/paraphrasing_bert.ipynb.
* The notebook paraphrasing/Paraphrasing_graph_final.ipynb  provides a detailed analysis of the trained final model for the task of identifying paraphrasing in the text.
